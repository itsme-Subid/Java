# Java Basic Programs

The agenda of this repository is to help others and myself too.
I personally found it very useful for many times, generally I code a program but forget it very frequently, so this repository help by easy accessibility to my code and also easy to go through the programs.
 
## Installation JDK

To help you set up quickly, you can install the Coding Pack for Java, which also includes VS Code, the Java Development Kit (JDK), and essential Java extensions. The Coding Pack can be used as a clean installation, or to update or repair an existing development environment.

## Check your Jdk installation
To check that your Jdk tools are correctly installed and available, open a new Command Prompt and type:

```bash
javac --version

If you don't see the expected output or javac is not a recognized command. Make sure you followed the instructions on the [Azul Zulu website](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk) to install Jdk.
